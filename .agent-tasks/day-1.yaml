    title: "[D1-CRIT-A2] Contracts MVP Demo Readiness: JACKPolicyHook Deployment + Validation"
    requirement: |
      Finalize contracts stream readiness for the critical MVP demo using the current JACKPolicyHook implementation and verified behavior.
      
      ## Current State (Verified on February 6, 2026)
      - [x] `JACKPolicyHook` is implemented with `BaseHook` inheritance and `beforeSwap` enforcement.
      - [x] `PolicyChecked(bytes32 intentId, bool allowed, bytes32 reason)` is emitted in policy checks.
      - [x] Access control for policy updates is implemented (`owner` + delegated updater

    acceptance:
      - "`JACKPolicyHook` is implemented with `BaseHook` inheritance and `beforeSwap` enforcement."
      - "`PolicyChecked(bytes32 intentId, bool allowed, bytes32 reason)` is emitted in policy checks."
      - "Access control for policy updates is implemented (`owner` + delegated updater path)."
      - "Foundry tests pass locally: `11 passed, 0 failed` via `forge test -vv`."
      - "Deployment tooling exists (`DeployJACKPolicyHook.s.sol` + `deploy-hook.sh` + `smoke-hook.sh`)."
      - "`JACKSettlementAdapter` compiles when explicitly targeted (`forge build --contracts JACKSettlementAdapter.sol`), but it remains mock-level and has no dedicated tests."
      - "Testnet deployment executed and canonical hook address recorded for demo."
      - "End-to-end demo evidence captured for both allow and reject policy paths."
      - "Settlement adapter demo status finalized (either integrated + tested, or explicitly declared out-of-scope for MVP recording)."
      - "Dashboard/API wiring to real contract-demo path validated with stable env settings."
      - "Deployed hook address and network details are documented in the issue."
      - "Contract smoke checks (allow/reject) are executed and evidence is attached."
      - "Demo flow explicitly states what is live contract path vs mock/stub."
      - "Contract-related demo blockers are reduced to zero for MVP recording."

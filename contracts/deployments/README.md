# Contract Deployment Records

This folder stores deployment metadata generated by the deployment tooling.

## Structure

- `contracts/deployments/<env>/latest.json`: last deployment for that environment.
- `contracts/deployments/<env>/history.ndjson`: append-only deployment history.
- `contracts/deployments/<env>/logs/`: raw deploy logs.
- `contracts/deployments/<env>/smoke/`: smoke-check evidence reports.

## Environment names

- `development`
- `testnet`
- `mainnet`

## Notes

- Keep this history immutable for auditability.
- Never store private keys in deployment records.
- Mainnet ownership should point to a custody account (Safe/multisig).

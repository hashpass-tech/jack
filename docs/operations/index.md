# Runbooks & Operations

JACK ships with an operations toolkit for releasing, monitoring, and coordinating work across teams and agents. Use this section to manage delivery, automation, and release workflows.

## Included Runbooks

- **Agent Orchestration**: How we coordinate multi-agent execution.
- **Spec System**: The Kiro-style spec workflow for feature delivery.
- **Release Flow**: Testnet and mainnet deployment procedures.
- **Docs Pages Deployment**: GitHub Pages + DNS runbook for `docs.jack.lukas.money`.
- **Documentation Governance**: CI gates for critical API/contract changes and doc-impact metadata.
- **Documentation Changelog**: Auto-generated log of merged PRs and docs-impact summaries.
- **Contracts Deployment**: Environment-aware deploy and smoke-check workflow.
- **MVP Critical Roadmap**: Cross-stream checklist for demo readiness.
- **GitHub Tracker**: Terminal-based mission control for issues and tasks.
- **PR Merge Automation**: Auto-close linked issues on merge and optionally generate follow-up issues.

These runbooks keep execution deterministic beyond the kernel itself—ensuring operators have a predictable, repeatable playbook.

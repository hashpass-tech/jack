# JACK Whitepaper v1.0.0 (Foundational)

## Purpose

This is the foundational JACK whitepaper and the recommended starting point.

It explains the core model with minimal cognitive overhead, before readers move into
newer technical deltas in later versions.

## Core Thesis

JACK is an intent-first execution kernel for cross-chain operations.

- Users express outcomes, not transaction-by-transaction workflows.
- Solvers compete to execute those intents.
- Routing and provider integrations are externalized behind deterministic contracts.
- Settlement is policy-enforced on-chain.

## Why Start Here

- Shortest path to understand the system mental model.
- Less implementation noise than incremental technical revisions.
- Best orientation for product, operations, and mixed-technical stakeholders.

## Reading Path

1. Read this foundational version first (`v1.0.0`).
2. Continue with the latest technical whitepaper (`v1.0.2`) for integration and process details.
3. Use the whitepaper changelog to track differences between revisions.

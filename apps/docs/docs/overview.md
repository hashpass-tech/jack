# JACK Mission

JACK is the **cross-chain execution kernel** that turns high-level intents into verified, multi-chain outcomes. The mission is to make complex cross-chain operations feel like a single, reliable transaction by pairing a deterministic **Kernel** with pluggable **Hooks** for policy, routing, and settlement.

## What JACK Delivers

- **Intent-first execution**: capture the "what" once and let JACK orchestrate the "how" across chains.
- **Hook-driven policy**: enforce risk controls, permissions, and routing decisions at every step.
- **Kernel-led reliability**: the Kernel coordinates verification, status tracking, and fallback paths.
- **Operator-ready tooling**: runbooks, dashboards, and agent workflows to keep releases predictable.

## Product Surfaces

| Surface | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Landing** | Introduce the JACK Kernel and value story. |
| **Dashboard** | Author intents, inspect execution, and monitor policies. |
| **Kernel + Hooks** | The on-chain + off-chain execution engine powering cross-chain runs. |

Use the rest of this knowledge base to set up the platform, understand the architecture, and deliver a polished demo narrative.

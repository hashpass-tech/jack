# Runbooks & Operations

JACK ships with an operations toolkit for releasing, monitoring, and coordinating work across teams and agents. Use this section to manage delivery, automation, and release workflows.

## Included Runbooks

- **Agent Orchestration**: How we coordinate multi-agent execution.
- **Spec System**: The Kiro-style spec workflow for feature delivery.
- **Release Flow**: Testnet and mainnet deployment procedures.
- **GitHub Tracker**: Terminal-based mission control for issues and tasks.

These runbooks keep execution deterministic beyond the kernel itself—ensuring operators have a predictable, repeatable playbook.

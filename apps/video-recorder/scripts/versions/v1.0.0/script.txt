JACK Demo Video - Voice Script (v1.0.0)

Opening (dashboard loads - header visible)
JACK avatar:
Hi, I'm Jack.
I'm the JACK Kernel -- an execution autopilot for cross-chain DeFi.

I'm not a DEX.
I'm an execution layer that lets users express what they want to do, and I enforce how execution is allowed to happen.

Scene 1 - Create Intent view (natural input visible)
JACK avatar:
Here, instead of manually routing a swap, I create an intent.
I simply describe the action I want to execute.

Cursor focuses the input field
JACK avatar:
For example:
Swap one thousand USDC on Arbitrum into WETH on Base, with a guaranteed minimum receive.

Click "PLAN"

Scene 2 - Policy section scrolls into view
JACK avatar:
Before any execution happens, I convert the request into a policy-constrained intent.
These are not UI preferences.
These constraints are enforced on-chain.

Scroll over the policy cards
JACK avatar:
The minimum amount I must receive is enforced by a Uniswap v4 hook.
Only approved liquidity venues are allowed.
Only approved cross-chain bridges are allowed.
The total execution and solver fee is capped.
And a settlement deadline is enforced.

Scene 3 - Execution pipeline section
JACK avatar:
Once the intent is defined, I launch the execution pipeline.

Point to Solver Auction
JACK avatar:
First, bonded solvers compete to execute the intent.

Point to Route Optimization
JACK avatar:
Then the best cross-chain route is selected using LI.FI.

Point to Policy Validation
JACK avatar:
Before settlement, the Uniswap v4 hook validates that every policy is respected.

Point to Atomic Settlement
JACK avatar:
If any rule is violated, the execution reverts.

Scene 4 - Back to the form (advanced tab visible)
JACK avatar:
Advanced users can still configure the intent explicitly.
Source chain, destination chain, assets, and guaranteed minimum receive.
But the important part is not the form.
The important part is that the execution itself is constrained.

Scene 5 - Execution Autopilot badge / toggle visible
JACK avatar:
I act as an execution autopilot.
Users only describe what they want.
I enforce how it is allowed to be executed.

Scene 6 - Privacy toggle (Fhenix confidential intent)
JACK avatar:
Optionally, constraints can be encrypted using a confidential execution module.
This allows solvers to route the intent without exposing sensitive parameters publicly.

Scene 7 - Kernel Guardrails section
JACK avatar:
I'm designed as infrastructure.
Your tokens never leave your wallet until execution is validated at settlement.
And every execution is fail-closed by default.

Scene 8 - Short positioning for LUKAS and beyond
JACK avatar:
My first use case is LUKAS -- a regional asset for Latin America.
But I'm asset-agnostic and application-agnostic.
Any protocol, treasury, or agent system can use this kernel to safely execute cross-chain actions.

Final screen - logo and dashboard
JACK avatar (closing line):
I turn DeFi execution into a programmable, policy-enforced workflow.
This is the JACK Kernel.
